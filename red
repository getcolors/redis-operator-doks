// Redis launcher: one Redis 7.2 server on one Vultr instance, DigitalOcean
// droplet or AWS EC2 instance, published on loopback only, reached over an SSH
// tunnel, with RDB backup sets in Cloudflare R2 or a deployment-owned S3 bucket.
//
// Desired state lives in colors.yml, found by walking up from the working
// directory. Secrets and tokens are never written there: every credential key
// is supplied at runtime through a COLORS_PAR_* environment variable, which is
// overlaid onto the matching flat key.
//
// COLORS_PAR_PROFILE is the exception: redis refuses to run when it is set.
// The profile names this project's work directory, OpenTofu state key, machine
// keypair and cloud resources, and overriding it from the environment can only
// point redis at another project's state.
//
// This file is both the skill payload and the repository entry point: red/red
// in the repository is a symlink to it. It deliberately holds no logic of its
// own: validation, the graph and the steps all live in the `package-redis-operator-red`
// library, where the test suite reaches them. A copied payload is the one place
// in this project where code cannot be tested, so nothing that can live
// elsewhere should live here.

// The commits a copied payload must resolve. Managed by `bb pin`: do not edit

//
// "package-redis-operator-red" is null before this repository has been pushed and
// stamped: a launcher that cannot resolve its own library says so rather than
// inventing a SHA or silently falling back to whatever is lying around.
// `bb pin` refuses to stamp a dirty or unpushed HEAD for the same reason, and
// rewrites null to "github:getcolors/redis-operator#<sha>" in place.
//
// These are live code rather than a comment because the launcher resolves them
// itself (see below). They stay out of a bundled package.json in this
// directory, which would halt Bun's upward resolution of `package-redis-operator-red`
// and break the development symlink at red/red.

// Ordinary resolution still wins when it succeeds, which is what keeps a

// add-deps. REDIS_OPERATOR_LIB_ROOT overrides everything with a working tree: point it
// at a redis checkout (its root, or its `red/` directory) whose dependencies
// are installed, and the copied payload runs those sources instead of any pin.
